# IPC Agent

**‚ÄºÔ∏è The IPC Agent, the IPC actors, and eudico haven't been audited, tested in depth, or otherwise verified. Moreover, the system is missing critical recovery functionality in case of crashes. There are multiple ways in which you may lose funds moved into an IPC subnet, and we strongly advise against deploying IPC on mainnet and/or using it with tokens with real value.**

The IPC Agent is the entry point to interacting with IPC. It is a client application that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to interact with IPC as a user and run all the processes required for the operation of a subnet.

>üí° **We've prepared a [quick start guide](/docs/quickstart-calibration.md) that will have you running and validating on your own subnet quickly, at the cost of detailed explanations.**

## Branching Strategy

### Production branch

The production branch is `main`.
The `main` branch is always compatible with the "stable" release of eudico that's running on Spacenet.
Updates to `main` **always** come from the `dev` branch.

### Development branch

The primary development branch is `dev`.
`dev` contains the most up-to-date software but may not be compatible with the version of eudico running on spacenet. Only use `dev` if doing a full local deployment, but note that the packaged deployment scripts default to checking out eudico `spacenet`. 

## Building

To build the IPC Agent you need to have Rust installed in your environment. The current MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) is nightly-2022-10-03 due to some test build dependencies. A working version is tracked in rust-toolchain (this is picked up by rustup automatically). You can look for instructions on [how to run Rust and rustup following this link](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

>üí° According to the operating system you are running, you may have to install additional dependencies not installed in your system to follow these instructions like `build-essential`, `libssl-dev`, `git`, `curl`, and `pkg-config`. If something fails while building the binaries double-check these dependencies.

To build the binary for the IPC agent you need to build the requirements in your environment, clone this repo, and build the binary following these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/ipc-agent.git
cd ipc-agent
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
make build
```

This builds the binary of the IPC agent in the `./bin` folder of your repo. If you want to make the command available everywhere, add this folder to the binary `PATH` of your system. To see if the installation was successfully you can run the following command:

## Eudico

IPC uses [a fork of Lotus](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/lotus), which we like to call _Eudico_, to connect to the rootnet and run subnets. To ease the deployment of new nodes, Eudico provides [a set of infrastructure scripts](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/lotus/tree/spacenet/scripts/ipc) that make use of Docker. In order to install Docker, [click this link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and follow the instructions for your working environment.

>üí° Some users have reported some issues trying to build the required images using Docker Desktop. Consider installing a version of [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server) supported by your system.

With Docker installed, you can then `make install-infra` in the root of the `ipc-agent` repo. This will clone the eudico repo, build the docker image that you need to run subnets, and install the infrastructure scripts in the `./bin` folder.

In Unix-based systems, it is highly recommended to include your user in the `docker` group to avoid having to run many of the commands from this tutorial using `sudo`. You can achieve this running:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

## Connecting to a rootnet

You can deploy an IPC hierarchy from any compatible rootnet. At this time, your options are to use the public Spacenet testnet or to deploy or your own rootnet. Instructions are provided for both below, but we recommend using Spacenet if possible.

### Option 1: Spacenet
Spacenet hosts all the IPC actors and can be used as a rootnet on which to deploy new subnets. For more information, have a look at the [Spacenet repo](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/spacenet).

In order to use the IPC agent with Spacenet we need to have access to a full node syncing with the network. The easiest way to achieve this is to run your own. Please follow the instructions on the [Spacenet repo](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/spacenet/blob/main/README.md#getting-started-for-developers) to install the dependencies and set up your node.

With the node running, you are ready to connect the IPC agent to Spacenet. For this, you'll need to get an authentication token for your node and create a wallet for the interaction.

*Example*:
```console
# Generate auth token to node
$ ./eudico auth token create --perm admin
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJBbGxvdyI6WyJyZWFkIiwid3JpdGUiLCJzaWduIiwiYWRtaW4iXX0.8vIV7pCrWx-nxOBAAw_IayDzrGf22kMjagRYmj_8Qqw

# Create new wallet
$ ./eudico wallet new
t1cp4q4lqsdhob23ysywffg2tvbmar5cshia4rweq
```

This information will be relevant to configure our agent to connect to this rootnet node.

To be able to interact with Spacenet and run new subnets, some FIL should be provided to, at least, the wallet that will be used by the agent to interact with IPC. You can request some Spacenet FIL for your address through the [Spacenet Faucet](https://spacenet.consensus.ninja/).

### Option 2: Local deployment
To deploy a Example rootnet locally for testing you can use the IPC scripts installed in `./bin/ipc-infra` by running:
```bash
./bin/ipc-infra/run-root-docker-1val.sh <lotus-api-port> <validator-libp2p-port>
```

For instance, running `./bin/ipc-infra/run-root-docker-1val.sh 1234 1235` will run a rootnet daemon listening at `localhost:1234`, and a single validator mining in the rootnet listening through its libp2p host in `localhost:1235`.

*Example*:
```console
$ ./bin/ipc-infra/run-root-docker-1val.sh 1234 1235
(...)
>>> Root daemon running in container: 84711d67cf162e30747c4525d69728c4dea8c6b4b35cd89f6d0947fee14bf908
>>> Token to /r31415926 daemon: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJBbGxvdyI6WyJyZWFkIiwid3JpdGUiLCJzaWduIiwiYWRtaW4iXX0.j94YYOr8_AWhGGHQd0q8JuQVuNhJA017SK9EUkqDOO0
>>> Default wallet: t1cp4q4lqsdhob23ysywffg2tvbmar5cshia4rweq
```
This information will be relevant to configure our agent to connect to this rootnet node.

## Configuring the agent

The default config path for the agent is `~/.ipc-agent/config.toml`. The agent will always try to pick up the config from this path unless told otherwise. To populate a Example config file in the default path, you can run the following command:
```bash
./bin/ipc-agent config init
```

The `/r31415926` section of the agent's `config.toml` must be updated to connect to your node. In the examples above, we need to set the endpoint of our rootnet node to be `127.0.0.1:1234`, and replace the `auth_token` and `account` with the ones provided by our node.

*Example*:
```toml
[[subnets]]
id = "/r31415926"
network_name = "root"

[subnets.config]
network_type = "fvm"
accounts = ["t1cp4q4lqsdhob23ysywffg2tvbmar5cshia4rweq"]
auth_token = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJBbGxvdyI6WyJyZWFkIiwid3JpdGUiLCJzaWduIiwiYWRtaW4iXX0.j94YYOr8_AWhGGHQd0q8JuQVuNhJA017SK9EUkqDOO0"
gateway_addr = "t064"
jsonrpc_api_http = "http://127.0.0.1:1234/rpc/v1"
```

> üí° In the current implementation of Spacenet, the gateway is always deployed in the `t064` address. This should be the address always reflected on your config for the gateway. In the future, this will change, and the gateway may be deployed in different addresses.

> üí° If you are already running the daemon, then run `./bin/ipc-agent config reload` to pick up the config changes.

## Running
The IPC agent runs as a foreground daemon process that spawns a new JSON RPC server to interact with it, and all the processes to automatically handle checkpoints and the execution of cross-net messages for the subnets our agent is participating in. The agent determines the list of subnets it should interact with from its config file.

Alternatively, the agent can also be used as a CLI to interact with IPC. Under the hood, this cli sends new commands to the RPC server of the daemon. To run the IPC agent daemon you can run:
```bash
./bin/ipc-agent daemon
```

The RPC server of the daemon will be listening to the endpoint determined in the `json_rpc_address` field of the config. If you are looking for your agent to be accessible from Docker or externally, remember to listen on `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1` as specified in the default config.

To check if the agent has connected to the rootnet successfully, you can try using it to create a new wallet.

*Example*:
```console
$ ./bin/ipc-agent wallet new -w fvm --key-type bls
2023-03-30T12:01:11Z INFO  ipc_agent::cli::commands::manager::wallet] created new wallet with address WalletNewResponse { address: "t3u7djutz4kwshntg4abams37ssy63irkfykqimodh4fs7krdst3y5qwcptvexmvic6gs5q6qygerminm2r3la" } in subnet "/r31415926"
```
